  This demo is based on the GD32E507Z-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to use TMU to calculate
the value. In this demo, the mode0 is used for TMU. The input value and output value
meet IEEE 32-bit single precision floating-point format.If read the overflow flag and
underflow flag to guarantee no error occurs, read the output data and turn on the LED3
and LED4, otherwise turn on the LED1 and LED2.
  You can input value by usart0, the value between -1 and 1. if no erro occured, the result 
of calculation will be printed by usart0.
   JP13 must be fitted to the USART0 port.
